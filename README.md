# GPA Calculator
Like a typical student, grades are catalysts for creating obsession towards letters granted for our work. 
I created this to help ease the need to make mundane calculations in instances where I'd need to find my GPA in an instance where a grade were to change or if I needed a GPA for an application for something.


## Improvements to make
Definitely could incorporate a function to automatically output your GPA if the amount of classes you inputted is reached.
